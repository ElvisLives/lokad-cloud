Worker Diagnostics
==================

Diagnostics to log what's going on in the application host (and only the host, not in your Application running on that host).

   * AppHost itself
   * Storage (only when used by the host, e.g. for reading deployments)
   * Provisioning

Note that diagnostics for applications is controlled instead in the app's EntryPoint.
